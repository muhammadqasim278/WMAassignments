        Chicken Yakhni Pulao is a traditional South Asian rice dish made with chicken, fragrant spices, and aromatic broth called yakhni. The term "regular" in this context refers to a standard or typical preparation of the dish without any specific variations.
        
        In Chicken Yakhni Pulao, the chicken is cooked in a flavorful broth made by simmering meat, spices, and herbs. This broth is then used to cook the rice, resulting in a delicious and aromatic rice dish with tender chicken pieces. The spices used in Yakhni Pulao can vary but commonly include cumin, coriander, cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves. Other ingredients such as onions, garlic, ginger, and mint may also be added for additional flavor.</b></p>
