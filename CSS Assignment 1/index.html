            </div>

            <div class="text">
                <span class="p1a">
                    In the journey of life, where dreams take flight,<br>
                    There lies a quest for success, burning bright. <br>
                </span>
                <span class="p1b">
                    It's not just the laurels or treasures we amass,<br>
                    But the lessons we learn while crossing the vast. <br><br>
                </span>

                <span class="p2a">
                    Success is not measured by mere worldly gains,<br>
                    But by the battles fought amidst struggles and pains. <br>
                </span>
                <span class="p2b">
                    It's the courage to rise when we stumble and fall,<br>
                    To heed the inner voice, to answer the call. <br><br>
                </span>

                <span class="p3a">
                    Success is the rhythm of a relentless beat,<br>
                    A symphony composed by the dreams we meet. <br>
                </span>
                <span class="p3b">
                    It's the passion that ignites a fire within,<br>
                    A relentless pursuit, where we always begin. <br><br>
                </span>

                <span class="p4a">
                    It's not the destination, but the path we tread,<br>
                    The choices we make, and the risks we shed. <br>
                </span>
                <span class="p4b">
                    Success lies in the kindness we bestow,<br>
                    The love we share, and the seeds we sow. <br><br>
                </span>

                <span class="p5a">
                    It's the laughter that echoes, the joy we find,<br>
                    In moments of triumph, in ties that bind. <br>
                </span>
                <span class="p5b">
                    Success is the harmony of a life well lived,<br>
                    With purpose and meaning, our souls are uplifted.
