    <p><b>
        A crispy chicken burger is a type of sandwich where a breaded and fried chicken patty is used as the main filling. It is a popular fast food item and can be found in many restaurants and fast food chains.

The crispy chicken patty is typically made by coating a chicken breast or chicken meat with seasoned flour or breadcrumbs and then deep-frying or pan-frying it until it becomes golden and crispy. The result is a crunchy and flavorful chicken patty that is placed inside a burger bun.</b></p>
