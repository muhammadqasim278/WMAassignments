    <h1>Beef Qorma (Boneless)</h1>

    <h2>Rs. 200.00</h2><br><br>

    <p><b>Beef Qorma, also known as Beef Korma, is a popular dish in South Asian cuisine. The term "boonless" seems to be a typographical error, as the correct term would be "boneless."

        Beef Qorma Boneless refers to a preparation of the dish using boneless beef instead of beef with bones. In this variation, boneless beef is typically used, which means that the meat has been removed from the bones before cooking. Boneless beef is often preferred in certain dishes for its ease of eating and convenience.</b></p>
